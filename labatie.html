            <h3>Project Context</h3>
            <h4 class="first">Overview</h4>
            <p class="project-text">A visual brand identity for La Batie Festival de Geneve which brings in inspiration from renowned designers Dan Friedman and Wim Crouwel. The purpose of which was not to copy their style but to research what made the masters successful and apply the learnings in a more contemporary style. Ultimately, the result is a microsite which pushes the boundaries of how expressive web interaction can be, while considering functional aspects such that users can understand the site.</p>

            <h4>About the Festival</h4>
            <p class="project-text">La Batie is an annual festival occurring in the late summer at Geneva, Switzerland where artists abroad perform music, theatre, and contemporary dance performances. <em class="bold">Le Poudrier Cabaret</em> is the nightlife program of the festival, highlighted with shows and themes from drag artists.</p>
            
            <h4>A Highly Fluent Audience</h4>
            <p class="project-text">The microsite is intended for an audience that accustomed to artistic experiences, both in the physical world of attending events such as La Batie as well as through digital experiences. With this in mind, we were able to design a microsite that is dedicated to the drag artists of La Batie's Le Poudrier events. The site is meant to be a post-show experience, evoking memories of the cabaret shows drag community and financially supporting the artists who are often discriminated in today's societal standards.

            <h3>Designer Precedents</h3>
            <h4 class="first">Dan Friedman</h4>
            <p class="project-text">Friedman's work inspired us to push the boundaries between legibility and unpredictability by engaging negative space through wide spacing of letters</p>

            <h4>Wim Crouwel</h4>
            <p class="project-text">From Wim Crouwel, we learned his need for consistency in a design and strict willingness to deviate from the grid.</p>

        <div class="project-content">
            <h3>Lateral Exploration of Visual Concepts</h3>
            <!-- <h4>Exploring Visual Concepts</h4> -->
            <p class="project-text">In the first two weeks of the project we explored the design qualities through visual design experimentation including posters and visual assets that would attract attention to the La Batie Event. The purpose here was to rigorously experiment different visual styles while keeping the learnings from the precedent studies of Friedman and Crouwel in focus. As the project progressed, we learned more from these designers and thus our understandings of their work shifted.</p>
            
            <h4>Typographic Grid</h4>
            <p class="project-text">The First line of investigation explored a typographic grid where the structure of the grid is informed by small groups of typography and imagery, and the negative space between the groupings create pockets of space that command attention to particular elements in the hierarchy. In addition, stacking short segments of typography with close crop framing of content was explored to establish feelings of mystery and suspense by inviting the viewer to speculate what might be the remaining part of the frame.</p>

            <h4>Piecing Together the Whole</h4>
            <p class="project-text">This line of investigation investigated a concept that fragmented typography about the page. While being careful about not causing visual distractions, the reader is invited the reader to piece together the elements to understand the whole composition. The type is carefully placed in orientations that leads the eye throughout the composition. The structure of the geometric elements is to create order in the composition which allows the type to be more unpredictable.</p>

            <h4>Stacking Typography with Short Line Widths</h4>
            <p class="project-text">The Third line of investigation we surfaced was driven by stacking narrow images and text with short line-lengths, which created tension by emphasizing asymmetry through diagonal lines. Pockets of negative space are sculpted by the asymmetrical elements which direct the eye towards the next element in the composition.</p>

            <h3>Pivot Point</h3>
            <h4 class="first">Which Direction to Proceed With</h4>
            <p class="project-text">The next portion of the project required the team to select one direction to pursue further for web interactions. As were still looking to explore other visual design concepts, we took a closer look at the qualities from our precedent studies to see where the greatest opportunity was. At this point, we acknowledged that while the qualities we pulled from Friedman and Crouwel were clear, they needed to be more compelling to really engage an audience of talented designers.</p>
            <p class="project-text">A large commitment the team had to make was placing personal biases aside to determine which direction the team was feeling strongest about, while also considering the feedback from the teaching team and guest critics. Ultimately, we decided the graphicical concept of stacking typography with close crop framing of images had the most potential to intrigue an audience.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project-content">
            <h3>Exploring Interaction Design</h3>
            <p class="project-text">Touching back on the intended audience of this website; they are a highly fluent audience of individuals who welcome a visual challenge and intriguing path as long as they can still navigate their way throughout the site.</p>
            <p class="project-text">We explored three lines of investigation once again, each being a small sample of what the final site might look like, and further employing expressive interactions over functional ones to intrigue the audience. To help frame this exploration, a fully functional site could be an e-commerce site you may see for a clothing brand. In this project's context, even the site we identified as most functional is quite expressive compared to fully functional sites.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project-content">
            <h3>Direction 1</h3>
            <h4 class="first">Mid-Expressive</h4>
            <p class="project-text">The strategy that went into designing this site was to illustrate the provocative and dynamic personalities of the performers who play an integral part in building the atmosphere of the cabaret shows. The content of the site was to be all about the performers who are often marginalized by society and don't have the opportunity to tell their story of what drag is.</p>
            <p class="project-text">The microsite employs fast paced interactions that shock and excite the user, drawing a similarity to the experience of a cabaret show and the exhuberant personalities of the performers.</p>

            <img class="project-img" src="img/labatie/most-functional.gif" alt="Sample gif of mid level expressive microsite">
        </div>

        <div class="project-content">
            <h3>Direction 2</h3>
            <h4 class="first">Expressive</h4>
            <p class="project-text">The driving principle of this microsite exploration was to display the interconnectedness of the four La Cabaret Poudrier performances by displaying elements of each event on screen at the same time. The intent is to give the user control of which content is displayed by resizing the four quadrants, changing the content in each quadrant depending on its relative size.</p>

            <img class="project-img" src="img/labatie/expressive.gif" alt="Sample gif of high level expressive microsite">
        </div>

        <div class="project-content">
            <h3>Direction 3</h3>
            <h4 class="first">Highly Expressive</h4>

            <p class="project-text">The intent of our most expressive site was to establish feelings of mystery and curiosity for viewers to discover the content of the site. One of the ways this was explored was by showing the user details of the event in small bits which serves as a reminder of the performance and incentivizes the user to explore further.</p>

            <img class="project-img" src="img/labatie/most-expressive.gif" alt="Sample gif of most expressive microsite">

            <p class="project-text">This was our most expressive microsite and one that we were interested in pursuing further while combining interaction and content strategies from our other two examples. Critique that we recieved was that the site felt like a teaser to lead the user to more content, which is something we explored deeply in the final iteration</p>
            <!-- <p clas="project-text">One of the reasons we pursued this direction further was the employment of the Friedman and Crouwel precedent studies where we were interested in stacking short segments of type to create negative space, and close crop framing of media content to intrigue the user to further explore.</p> -->
