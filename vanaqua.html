            <h3>Project Context</h3>
            <p class="project-text">We primarily focused on the ticket purchasing experience of the website because during the pandemic the Vancouver Aquarium was experiencing more web-traffic as guests were required to pre-purchase a ticket online prior to their visit. Furthermore, we believed that if this process was streamlined, people could be incentivized in the future to continue to use the service and skip the in-person line</p>

        <div class="project-content">
            <h3>Evalutation Method: Heuristic Analysis</h3>
            <h4 class="first">Applying our Expertise</h4>
            <p class="project-text">We started off our study with a heuristic analysis of the current website experience to familiarize ourselves with usability concerns website visitors may be having.</p>  
            <p class="project-text">With the heuristic evaluation, we primarily focused on the ticket purchasing experience, but our team also explored other aspects of the website to familiarize ourselves with the Vancouver Aquarium brand as well as be open to other pressing usability issues that may arise.</p>  


            <h3>Evaluation Method: Observational Test</h3>
            <h4 class="first">Expand on Heuristic Evalutation</h4>
            <p class="project-text">Next, we employed a simple observational test to confirm and expand on what we found during our heuristic evaluation. In some ways this surpassed our heuristic analysis as we got the chance to observe how people outside of a design context viewed the website experience.  We listened to where people struggled and how they described it, as well as allow participants to voice their opinions or suggestions with the website.</p>  

            <h4>Participant Recruitment</h4>
            <p class="project-text">The participants we recruited were as wide range of demographics as possible, with ages ranging from 21 to 56. The broad range of participants was useful as an insight we had from speaking with the Vancouver Aquarium was that people of various ages are frequently visiting the aquarium's website and purchasing tickets. Participants filled out a brief pre-test survey which helped us collect information about them to give our study credibility.</p>

            <h4>Tasks</h4>
            <p class="project-text">Initially, participants were asked to briefly explore around the site to see some features and get accustomed to the website but stay clear of the purchasing experience as we wanted to keep that portion of the website fresh. The first task participants completed was to purchase a general admission ticket on a specific date and time and seek directions to the aquarium.</p>
            <p class="project-text">Prior to conducting the tasks, participants were interviewed to gain knowledge of what their typical process was, to purchase a ticket first or look up directions to the location. The tasks were then structured depending on their natural process.</p>

            <h4>Post-test Interview</h4>
            <p class="project-text">We accompanied the tasks with a post-test interview to listen to how participants felt about the website overall as well as both of the tasks. We chose a semi-structured interview as it gave participants the opportunity to elaborate on any issues their found while conducting the tasks. Some examples of questions we asked were:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>How did you find purchasing a ticket? Explain what the process was like.</li>
                <li>What was the most difficult thing to understand or use when purchasing a ticket?</li>
                <li>How was finding directions to the Aquarium? Would you consider using their site in the future or navigating to another platform (such as Google Maps)?</li>
            </ol>
