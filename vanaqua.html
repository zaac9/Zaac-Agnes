            <h3>Project Context</h3>
            <p class="project-text">We primarily focused on the ticket purchasing experience of the website because during the pandemic the Vancouver Aquarium was experiencing more web-traffic as guests were required to pre-purchase a ticket online prior to their visit. Furthermore, we believed that if this process was streamlined, people could be incentivized in the future to continue to use the service and skip the in-person line</p>

        <div class="project-content">
            <h3>Evalutation Method: Heuristic Analysis</h3>
            <h4 class="first">Applying our Expertise</h4>
            <p class="project-text">We started off our study with a heuristic analysis of the current website experience to familiarize ourselves with usability concerns website visitors may be having.</p>  
            <p class="project-text">With the heuristic evaluation, we primarily focused on the ticket purchasing experience, but our team also explored other aspects of the website to familiarize ourselves with the Vancouver Aquarium brand as well as be open to other pressing usability issues that may arise.</p>  


            <h3>Evaluation Method: Observational Test</h3>
            <h4 class="first">Expand on Heuristic Evalutation</h4>
            <p class="project-text">Next, we employed a simple observational test to confirm and expand on what we found during our heuristic evaluation. In some ways this surpassed our heuristic analysis as we got the chance to observe how people outside of a design context viewed the website experience.  We listened to where people struggled and how they described it, as well as allow participants to voice their opinions or suggestions with the website.</p>  

            <h4>Participant Recruitment</h4>
            <p class="project-text">The participants we recruited were as wide range of demographics as possible, with ages ranging from 21 to 56. The broad range of participants was useful as an insight we had from speaking with the Vancouver Aquarium was that people of various ages are frequently visiting the aquarium's website and purchasing tickets. Participants filled out a brief pre-test survey which helped us collect information about them to give our study credibility.</p>

            <h4>Tasks</h4>
            <p class="project-text">Initially, participants were asked to briefly explore around the site to see some features and get accustomed to the website but stay clear of the purchasing experience as we wanted to keep that portion of the website fresh. The first task participants completed was to purchase a general admission ticket on a specific date and time and seek directions to the aquarium.</p>
            <p class="project-text">Prior to conducting the tasks, participants were interviewed to gain knowledge of what their typical process was, to purchase a ticket first or look up directions to the location. The tasks were then structured depending on their natural process.</p>

            <h4>Post-test Interview</h4>
            <p class="project-text">We accompanied the tasks with a post-test interview to listen to how participants felt about the website overall as well as both of the tasks. We chose a semi-structured interview as it gave participants the opportunity to elaborate on any issues their found while conducting the tasks. Some examples of questions we asked were:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>How did you find purchasing a ticket? Explain what the process was like.</li>
                <li>What was the most difficult thing to understand or use when purchasing a ticket?</li>
                <li>How was finding directions to the Aquarium? Would you consider using their site in the future or navigating to another platform (such as Google Maps)?</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="project-content">
            <h3>Results</h3>
            <h4 class="first">User Testing</h4>
            <p class="project-text">To our surprise, the participants had little to no issues with purchasing a ticket during the tasks. Many participants commented in the interviews that the process was very straightforward. Many participants didn't have major concerns, but there were still a few minor nuances that could be addressed. For example, one participant stated: "It was an easy process, but I felt like the first two options when buying a ticket were irrelevant since I was just trying to buy a general ticket".</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project-content">
            <h4>Adjustments to the Ticket Process</h4>
            <p class="project-text">While we were working with a polished site experiencing plenty of public use at the time, we were still able to address a few design implications through our usability study that can positively impact the company. For example, we suggested adjusting the order of the ticket purchasing process and reducing the number of buttons and screens users must go through.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project-content">
            <h4>Copywriting Issues</h4>
            <p class="project-text">Minor copywritng concerns appear throughout the website, our suggestion was to change the wording to avoid customer confusion. A few that we highlighted as the most pressing are:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The "shop" button in the corner of the home screen is misleading as it leads the user to the gift shop. A few of our participants tried clicking this when given the task of purchasing a ticket.</li>
                <li>The iconography of the information page appears to be a download link, when in fact it takes the user to the FAQ page</li>
                <li>While purchasing a ticket, the button to advance to the final stage of payment reads "place order", which stalled two of our participants when purchasing as they initially thought the process was complete. Popular marketplaces such as Amazon have their final button when making a purchase labeled "place order"</li>
            </ol>
        </div>


        <div class="project-content">
            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <h4 class="first">Value of Testing with Real People</h4>
            <p class="project-text">One important thing I learned throughout this project was how valuable user testing with the right audience is. Often as designers we see issues with design principles and specific usability concerns. While these concerns are important and can help the overall flow of a process, it is more beneficial to combine these with the needs of real customers.</p>
